# manymome

(Version 0.3.3, updated on 2026-01-07, [release
history](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/news/index.html))

Functions for estimating indirect effects, conditional indirect effects,
and conditional effects in a model with moderation, mediation, and/or
moderated mediation fitted by structural equation modelling (SEM) or
estimated by multiple regression. The package was introduced in:

- Cheung, S. F., & Cheung, S.-H. (2024). *manymome*: An R package for
  computing the indirect effects, conditional effects, and conditional
  indirect effects, standardized or unstandardized, and their bootstrap
  confidence intervals, in many (though not all) models. *Behavior
  Research Methods, 56*(5), 4862–4882.
  <https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02224-z>

# What Can It Do?

- Compute an unstandardized or *standardized* *indirect* *effect* or
  *conditional* *indirect* *effect* in a path model.

- Form the *confidence* *interval* for this effect. Nonparametric
  bootstrapping is fully supported, while Monte Carlo is supported for
  models fitted by
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html).

- Multigroup models fitted by
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html) are also
  supported in 0.1.14.2 and later versions. Details can be found in this
  [article](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/med_mg.html).

# Advantages

- **A Simpler Workflow**

  No need to define any parameters or similar code when fitting a model
  in [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html). Just
  focus on fitting the model first. After a model has been selected,
  users can compute the effect for nearly any path, from nearly any
  variable, to nearly any other variables, conditional on nearly any
  moderators, and at any levels of the moderators. (See
  [`vignette("manymome")`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/manymome.md)
  for details.) This is particularly convenient for multigroup models
  fitted by [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html),
  which are supported in 0.1.14.2 and later versions (see [this
  guide](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/med_mg.html), for
  an illustration).

- **Supports Both SEM-Based and Regression-Based Analysis**

  Supports structural equation models fitted by
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html) or by path
  models fitted by regression using
  [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html), although the focus of this
  package is on structural equation models. The interface of the main
  functions are nearly the same for both approaches.

- **Flexible in the Form of Models**

  No limit on the number of predictors, mediators, and outcome
  variables, other than those by
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html) and
  [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html). For multigroup models
  fitted by [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html),
  there is no inherent limit on the number of groups, other than the
  limit due to
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html), if any
  (supported in 0.1.14.2 and later versions).

- **Supports Standardized Effects**

  Can estimate standardized indirect effects and standardized
  conditional indirect effects without the need to standardize the
  variables. The bootstrap and Monte Carlo confidence intervals for
  standardized effects correctly take into account the sampling
  variation of the standardizers (the standard deviations of the
  predictor and the outcome variable) by recomputing them in each
  bootstrap sample or replication.

- **Supports Missing Data**

  Supports datasets with missing data through
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html) with full
  information maximum likelihood (`fiml`).

  In version 0.2.7.3 or later, it also supports missing data handled by
  multiple imputation if the models are fitted by
  [`lavaan.mi::sem.mi()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan.mi/man/lavaan.mi.html)
  or
  [`lavaan.mi::lavaan.mi()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan.mi/man/lavaan.mi.html)
  (see
  [`vignette("do_mc_lavaan_mi")`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/do_mc_lavaan_mi.md)).
  (Support for `semTools::runMI()` and its wrappers was removed in
  version 0.2.7.3 because this and related functions were deprecated in
  `semTools`.)

- **Supports Numeric and Categorical Moderators**

  Supports numeric and categorical moderators. It has a function
  ([`factor2var()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/factor2var.md))
  for the easy creation of dummy variables in
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html), and can
  also capitalize on the native support of categorical moderators in
  [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html).

- **Less Time for Bootstrapping**

  Bootstrapping, which can be time consuming, can be conducted just
  once. The main functions for computing indirect effects and
  conditional indirect effects can be called as many times as needed
  without redoing bootstrapping because they can reuse pregenerated
  bootstrap estimates (see
  [`vignette("manymome")`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/manymome.md)
  and
  [`vignette("do_boot")`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/do_boot.md)).

- **Supports Latent Variables Mediation**

  Supports indirect effects among latent variables for models fitted by
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html) (see
  [`vignette("med_lav")`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/med_lav.md)).

- **Support Treating Group As a Moderator**

  For multigroup models fitted by
  [`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html), it
  supports comparing the direct or indirect effects along any path
  between any two groups. That is, it uses the grouping variable as a
  moderator (illustrated
  [here](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/med_mg.html);
  supported in 0.1.14.2 and later versions).

# Limitations

Despite the aforementioned advantages, the current version of `manymome`
has the following limitations:

- Does not (officially) support categorical `x`-variables with more than
  two categories. Note that most functions will work with dichotomous
  `x`-variables, and the effect of `x` is simply the difference in
  predicted `y` between the two levels if coded as 0 and 1 (or any
  coding with a difference of 1, e.g., 1 and 2).

- Does not support multilevel models (although `lavaan` does).

- For bootstrapping, only supports nonparametric bootstrapping, and
  supports only percentile and bias-corrected confidence interval. Does
  not support other bootstrapping methods such parametric bootstrapping.

- Only supports OLS estimation when
  [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html) is used.

We would add more to this list (suggestions are welcomed by adding
[GitHub issues](#issues)) so that users (and we) know when other tools
should be used instead of `manymome`, or whether we can address these
limitations in `manymome` in the future.

# How To Use It?

A good starting point is the Get-Started article
([`vignette("manymome")`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/manymome.md)).

There are also
[articles](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/articles/index.html)
(vignettes) on special topics, such as how to use
[`mod_levels()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/mod_levels.md)
to set the levels of the moderators. More will be added.

# Background

We developed the package [`stdmod`](https://sfcheung.github.io/stdmod/)
in 2021 for moderated regression. We included a function
(`stdmod::stdmod_lavaan()`) for standardized moderation effect in path
models fitted by
[`lavaan::sem()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/sem.html). However, in
practice, path models nearly always included indirect effects and so
moderated mediation is common in path models. Moreover, `stdmod` is
intended for moderated regression, not for structural equation modeling.
We thought perhaps we could develop a more general tool for models
fitted by structural equation modelling based on the interface we used
in `stdmod::stdmod_lavaan()`. In our own projects, we also need to
estimate indirect effects in models frequently. Large sample sizes with
missing data are also common to us, for which bootstrapping is slow even
with parallel processing. Therefore, we developed `manymome` to address
these needs.
