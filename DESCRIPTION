Description: Computes indirect effects, conditional effects, and conditional
  indirect effects in a structural equation model or path model after model
  fitting, with no need to define any user parameters or label any paths in
  the model syntax. Can also form bootstrap confidence intervals by doing
  bootstrapping only once and reusing the bootstrap estimates in all
  subsequent computations. Supports bootstrap confidence intervals for
  standardized (partially or completely) indirect effects, conditional
  effects, and conditional indirect effects as described in Cheung (2009)
  <doi:10.3758/BRM.41.2.425> and Cheung, Cheung, Lau, Hui, and Vong (2022)
  <doi:10.1037/hea0001188>. Model fitting can be done by structural equation
  modeling using lavaan() or regression using lm().
