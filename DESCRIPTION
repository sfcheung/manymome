Description: Functions for computing indirect effects, moderation effects,
             and conditional indirect effects, and their bootstraping
             confidence interval. Support standadized (partially or completely)
             moderation effects and conditional indirect effects.
             For standardized effects that involve the moderator, the
             sampling variation in the standardization will be taken into
             account.
