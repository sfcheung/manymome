Description: Functions for computing indirect effects, conditional effects,
  and conditional indirect effects, and their bootstrap
  confidence intervals. Support standardized (partially or completely)
  indirect effects, conditional effects, and conditional indirect effects.
  Model fitting can be done by structural equation modeling
  using lavaan() or regression using lm().
