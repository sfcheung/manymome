\title{Estimates of Conditional Indirect Effects or Conditional Effects}
\usage{
\method{coef}{cond_indirect_effects}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The output of \code{\link[=cond_indirect_effects]{cond_indirect_effects()}}.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments. Ignored by the function.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector: The estimates of the conditional effects
or conditional indirect effects.
}
\description{
Return the estimates of the conditional indirect
effects or conditional effects for all levels in the output of
\code{\link[=cond_indirect_effects]{cond_indirect_effects()}}.
}
\details{
It extracts and returns the column \code{ind} or \code{std}
in the output of \code{\link[=cond_indirect_effects]{cond_indirect_effects()}}.
