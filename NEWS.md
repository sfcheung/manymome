# manymome 0.1.6

## New Features

### Bootstrapping

- Added `lm2boot_out_parallel()` to do bootstrapping with
  the output of `lm()` using parallel processing. This is
  the default when `do_boot()` is used on the outputs of
  `lm()`. (0.1.4.4)
- Added a print method for the output of `do_boot()`. (0.1.4.7)

### Mediation

- Added `all_indirect_paths()` for identifying all indirect paths
  in a model. (0.1.4.5)
- Added `many_indirect_effects()` for computing indirect
  effects for a list of paths. (0.1.4.5)
- Added `total_indirect_effect()` for computing the total
  indirect effect between two variables. (0.1.4.5)

## Bug Fixes

- Updated README.md with code for installing from CRAN. (0.1.4.1).
- Fixed a typo in README.md. (0.1.4.2)
- Fixed tests that should be done by `expect_equal` on numbers rather
  than on characters. No change in the functions. (0.1.4.3)
- Noted in the vignettes that some new functions are not
  yet on the CRAN version and available in the GitHub
  version. (0.1.4.6)
- Fixed a bug in `merge_model_frame()`. (0.1.4.8)
