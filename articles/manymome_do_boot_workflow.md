# Technical Appendix: Workflow of \`do_boot()\`

## Goal

This technical appendix describes how
[`do_boot()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/do_boot.md)
from the package [manymome](https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymome)
([Cheung & Cheung, 2024](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02224-z))
works to generate bootstrap estimates to be used by other functions to
form confidence intervals.

## `do_boot()`

Workflow of
[`manymome::do_boot()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/do_boot.md)

## `lavaan`

### `fit2boot_out()`

It retrieves stored bootstrap estimates.

Workflow of
[`manymome::fit2boot_out()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/fit2boot_out.md)

### `fit2boot_out_do_boot()`

Workflow of
[`manymome::fit2boot_out_do_boot()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/fit2boot_out.md)

## `lm`

### `lm2boot_out_parallel()`

Workflow of
[`manymome::lm2boot_out_parallel()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/lm2boot_out.md)

### `lm2boot_out()`

Workflow of
[`manymome::lm2boot_out()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/lm2boot_out.md)

## Notes

### Extracting Point Estimates

When the point estimates are needed, they will be extracted internally
using functions developed for the fit object, which can be a
`lavaan`-class object, a list of the outputs from
[`stats::lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html), or a `lavaan.mi`-class
object generated by fitting a model to several datasets using multiple
imputation.
