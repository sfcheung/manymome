# Technical Appendix: Workflow of \`cond_indirect()\`

## Goal

This technical appendix describes how
[`cond_indirect()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/cond_indirect.md)
from the package [manymome](https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymome)
([Cheung & Cheung, 2024](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02224-z))
works internally to extract the parameters and compute a conditional
indirect effect.

## `cond_indirect()`

Workflow of
[`manymome::cond_indirect()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/cond_indirect.md)

## `cond_indirect_effects()`

Workflow of
[`manymome::cond_indirect_effects()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/cond_indirect.md)

## `indirect_i()`

### Main workflow

Workflow of
[`manymome::indirect_i()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/indirect_i.md)

For `Call get_prod()`, see the workflow of `Creating prods`.

### `prods` not supplied

Creating `prods`

Workflow of
[`manymome::indirect_i()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/indirect_i.md):
Creating `prods`

## Notes

### Latent variables

If all variables along a path are latent variables, product term(s) must
be identified by their names because raw scores are not available.

Default uses `"_x_"`. For example, `f1_x_f2` is the product term between
`f1` and `f2`.

### Extracting Point Estimates and Variance-Covariance Matrix

When the point estimates or variance-covariance matrix of the point
estimates are needed, they will be extracted internally using functions
developed for the fit object, which can be a `lavaan`-class object, a
list of the outputs from
[`stats::lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html), or a `lavaan.mi`-class
object generated by fitting a model to several datasets using multiple
imputation.
