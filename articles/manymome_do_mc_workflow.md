# Technical Appendix: Workflow of \`do_mc()\`

## Goal

This technical appendix describes how
[`do_mc()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/do_mc.md) from
the package [manymome](https://cran.r-project.org/package=manymome)
([Cheung & Cheung, 2024](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02224-z))
works to generate Monte Carlo estimates to be used by other functions to
form confidence intervals.

## `do_mc()`

Workflow of
[`manymome::do_mc()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/do_mc.md)

## `fit2mc_out()`

It retrieves stored Monte Carlo estimates

Workflow of
[`manymome::fit2mc_out()`](https://sfcheung.github.io/manymome/reference/fit2mc_out.md)

## Notes

### Extracting Point Estimates and Variance-Covariance Matrix

When the point estimates or variance-covariance matrix of the point
estimates are needed, they will be extracted internally using functions
developed for the fit object, which can be a `lavaan`-class object, a
list of the outputs from
[`stats::lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html), or a `lavaan.mi`-class
object generated by fitting a model to several datasets using multiple
imputation.
